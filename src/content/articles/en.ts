          "I end the sitting when the child is still willing, not when I have reached a round number. Twenty minutes that ends with a closed binder will happen again. An hour that ends with a sigh might not. The [[collections hub|/collections]] will remember the lines I logged. Nothing on the screen is more important than the child wanting to open the binder next time.",
          "I do not track a child's binder as a contest against mine. The public pages of this project are my checklists. A kid's page is allowed to be unfinished forever. If they grow into the longer hobby, the set lists and the species pages are there. If they do not, the binder still did its job: cards in order, sleeves on, an afternoon that belonged to them.",
          "The questions I actually answer are small. Which pocket does this one go in. Can this duplicate fill a hole. Is it all right to stop. Yes, the numbered pocket. Yes, if the line is empty. Yes, stop. I keep the bigger opinions to myself unless the child asks. A collection started this way can stay tiny and still be a real collection. It has an order, a sleeve, and a next empty line whenever someone feels like opening it.",
